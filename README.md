- Perform EDA and any data cleaning    
- Implement Feature Scaling to Normalize the data(compare the histogram/KDE for MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler). Choose the best one of the Scaler to proceed ahead   
- Find optimal number of features using RFECV  
- Implement KMeans Clustering for K=2 to K=15 and based on elbow method identify the optimum number of clusters  
- Implement PCA with number of original features to answer how much variance is explained by first 2 components and by first 4 components  
- Implement XGBoost Classifier with 5 Fold CV and report the performance metrics

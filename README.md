IMPLEMENTATION:  

- EDA and Data Preprocessing    
- Feature Scaling to Normalize the data(compare the histogram/KDE for MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler)    
- Find optimal number of features using RFECV  
- KMeans Clustering for K=2 to K=15 and based on elbow method identify the optimum number of clusters  
- PCA with number of original features to answer how much variance is explained by first 2 components and by first 4 components  
- XGBoost Classifier with 5 Fold CV  
- performance metrics
